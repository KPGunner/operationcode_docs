We have some exciting news! We just learned that in honor of #GivingTuesday, Facebook and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will contribute up to $1 million to Facebook fundraisers. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will provide $500,000 in matching funds, up to $1,000 per Facebook fundraiser, and Facebook will waive up to $500,000 of fees on all donations.

How can you help?

As a supporter of Operation Code, we’d be honored if you would take this opportunity to reflect upon your commitment to our work by creating a Facebook fundraiser. Your fundraiser could help fund up to $1,000 toward our cause. Creating a fundraiser is easy. Here’s how to create a fundraiser:

• Go to https://www.facebook.com/operationcode.org/fundraisers 
• Click “Create Fundraiser”
• Select from one of three cover photos (or create your own)
• Add a title, tell your story, add an end date and a goal
• Be sure to include #GivingTuesday in your description, then click Create
• From there you can invite friends, share on your News Feed or send a message
• For inspiration, check out current fundraisers on our page at: https://www.facebook.com/operationcode.org/fundraisers 

Thank you for your support of Operation Code!
